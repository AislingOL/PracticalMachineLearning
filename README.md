Human Activity Recognition is a key research area. People regularly quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but not how well they do it. In this project, we use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm and dumbell of 6 particupants to predict the manner in which they did the exercise.

The outcome variable to be predicted is classe, a factor variable.

The .html and .Rmd files can be found in this repo, in the gh-pages branch so the html can be viewed as a webpage for ease of viewing: https://aislingol.github.io/PracticalMachineLearning/Modelling-and-Predicting-Exercise.html
